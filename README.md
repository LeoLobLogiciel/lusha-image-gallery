# Leo Lob - Home assignment for Lusha

This software has two separated project:
- client
- server

## Start the server
Make sure there arenÂ´t any other process taking the 8080 port.

Open a terminal in /server path, and then
```
npm i
npm run build
npm start
```

The API server starts listening on port 8080

## Start the client
Make sure there aren`t any other process taking the 3000.

Open another terminal (dont close the first one), and move to /client path.  Then:
```
npm i
npm start
```

The frontend React app will start on http://localhost:3000
